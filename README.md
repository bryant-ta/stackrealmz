*Stack resources, discover new cards, and defend your village!*

Stackrealmz is a solo project spin-off of Stacklands with a rolling-style shop, new crafting recipes, and 23 custom unit cards. It is a unique blend of stacking cards as a crafting mechanism mixed with CCG-esque combat cards.

This is a PROTOTYPE. Please excuse the mess. :)

## Combat Rules

Most of this is in the in game tutorial pop-up!

- Battles will start at "night" when the top right time bar fills up.
- Cards have HP, Attack, Speed, and Mana Cost
  - HP - Green - card is destroyed when this reaches 0
  - Attack - Red - card hits for this much after number of turns equal to Speed
  - Speed - Yellow (inspector only) - card attacks after this number of turns
    - shows as a yellow filling bar next to card in battle
  - Mana Cost - Blue - card cost this much to play
- Cards attack the closest enemy in the same row. There are some exceptions :)
- If an enemy attack your empty row, you lose Player HP. You lose when this reaches 0!
- Spells must be slotted before battle begins and cannot be swapped.
- There are 10 waves of enemies to survive. Good luck!
